usage: autohexrepl.py -h

An automated hex editor designed to replace bytes.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  -hx HX       The file we want to edit in hexadecimal format.
  -of OF       A file with offsets and bytes in hexadecimal format:
               [offsets... - bytes...], where n(offsets)=n(bytes), n is the
               number
  --nm NM      The name or path to the file to which we want to save the
               changes, because it will be safer to change a copy of the
               original.
  --no_output  Do not output the data of the copy of the edited file.

example: autohexrepl.py -hx name_editable_file -of offsets_bytes.txt

Data inside offsets_bytes.txt must be in hexadecimal 
form with the prefix [0x..] and are written in the following format:
    offsets... - bytes(or rand)...

The "rand" argument can be used instead of bytes.
rand - means that a random generated byte will be substituted instead.

Example of data inside offsets_bytes.txt: 
  0xa 0xb 0xc 0xd - rand 0x4b rand 0x2b

To test, go to the Testing folder, and type the following: 
  python3 ../autohexrepl.py -hx test_hex_file.auth -of offsets_bytes.txt
